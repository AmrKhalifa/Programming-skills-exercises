"# Programming-skills-exercises" 
The repository includes different topics:
### Algorithms and DataStructures ###
My solutions to Data Structures and Algortihms in Python book by Michael H. Goldwasser, Michael T. Goodrich, and Roberto Tamassia.
Divided by chapters. 
I only solve the chapters with  mostly code questions, so chapter 2 is omitted, I also only solve code problems - for now - proof problems and skipped.
